Various Javascript Utilities
============================

This repository stores javascript utilities that I have found helpful.

* file_loading

This HTML page and JS file allow a user to load a file into the browser to be
manpulated by the webpage. I envision using this for more complex logging
systems where the log itself is a large text file, or JSON/whatever, that the
browser can parse.

I figure this could be used for logging systems or table top RPG character
creators, etc.
